# Apple UI Diagnostics

Ensure your app is fast, reliable, and bug-free with advanced debugging and testing techniques.

## Areas of Expertise
- **[Performance](references/performance.md)** – Identifying bottlenecks, minimizing view updates, and using the SwiftUI Instrument.
- **[Debugging](references/debugging.md)** – Troubleshooting view identity, state changes, and preview crashes.
- **[UIKit Animation Debugging](references/uikit-animation.md)** – Specialized analysis for animation hitches and jank.
- **[UI Testing](references/testing.md)** – Writing reliable XCUITest cases with condition-based waiting and UI Automation.

## Usage
Use this skill when:
- Investigating UI lag or high CPU usage.
- Troubleshooting why a view isn't updating as expected.
- Implementing a robust automated UI testing suite.
