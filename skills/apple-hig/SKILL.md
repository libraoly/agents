# Apple Human Interface Guidelines

The definitive guide for building native, high-quality interfaces for Apple platforms. Use this skill to ensure compliance with Apple's design standards and to leverage advanced visual systems.

## Platform Specific Guidelines
- **[iOS (iPhone)](references/ios.md)** – Layout, thumb zone, touch targets, and mobile-first patterns.
- **[iPadOS (iPad)](references/ipados.md)** – Multitasking, sidebars, pointer support, and Apple Pencil.
- **[macOS (Mac)](references/macos.md)** – Menu bars, complex windowing, deep keyboard control, and Dock integration.

## Design Systems & Visuals
- **[General HIG Reference](references/general-hig.md)** – Core design decision frameworks, typography, and color systems.
- **[Liquid Glass](references/liquid-glass.md)** – Material design system (iOS 26+) for advanced depth and lensing effects.
- **[SF Symbols](references/sf-symbols.md)** – Mastery of Apple's iconography, rendering modes, and animations.

## Usage
1. **Identify the Target Platform**: Refer to the platform-specific guide first.
2. **Review Core Systems**: Check SF Symbols or Liquid Glass for specific visual implementations.
3. **Validate Compliance**: Use the checklists in each reference to audit your UI.

Use this skill whenever you are making design decisions, defending design choices, or auditing a UI for native "look and feel."
