# Apple App Architecture

Standardize your app's structure and data flow using industry-proven architectural patterns.

## Areas of Expertise
- **[Architecture Patterns](references/architecture.md)** – MVVM, TCA, Coordinator, and property wrapper decisions (@State, @Observable, etc.).
- **[App Composition](references/composition.md)** – App-level structure, @main, scene lifecycle, and modularization strategies.

## Usage
Use this skill when:
- Starting a new project and deciding on an architectural foundation.
- Refactoring existing code to improve testability and maintainability.
- Designing how different features and modules interact at the app level.
