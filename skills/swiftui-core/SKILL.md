# SwiftUI Core

Master the building blocks of SwiftUI to create responsive, interactive, and native-feeling interfaces.

## Areas of Expertise
- **[Layout](references/layout.md)** – Adaptive layout patterns, grids, alignment, and GeometryReader.
- **[Navigation](references/navigation.md)** – Mastering NavigationStack, NavigationSplitView, and deep linking.
- **[Gestures](references/gestures.md)** – Composition, priorities, and custom interactive gestures.

## Usage
Use this skill when you need to:
- Build a responsive layout that works across devices.
- Implement complex navigation flows or multi-column interfaces.
- Add advanced interactions and gesture recognition to your views.
